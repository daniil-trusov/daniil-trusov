# Hello there, I'm Daniil! 👋
🎨 Frontend developer | 🚀 Fullstack enthusiast | 🔧 Former QA Engineer


## 🚀 About Me
💡 I love building maintainable and reusable components — but I enjoy crafting the dynamic tools and functions behind them even more!

🔍 With a background in QA, I’ve developed a sharp eye for bugs — though honestly, they often find me first

🧠 Always up for a challenge — in university, I didn’t know any frontend tech, so I built the UI using Unity!

🚀 Constantly exploring new technologies and development tricks to improve my work

🎬 Wrote a script and directed several short films with friends
